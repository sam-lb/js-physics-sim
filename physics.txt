List of features to be added to the simulator
- Yung gravity (local and planetary)
- Electrostatic force
- Friction
- Drag
- rotation

Qualities of objects
- Mass, density, area, charge, color, moment of inertia, coefficients of friction (static and kinetic), drag coefficient, center of mass, 

Variables
- accleration, velocity, position, speed, translational kinetic energy, rotational kinetic energy, gravitational potential energy, elastic potential energy, angular velocity, angular acceleration, angle, momentum, angular momentum

global constants
- G = 6.67*10^-11 m^3/(kg*s^2)
- g = 9.81 m/s^2
- e = 1.60 * 10^(-19) Coul
- k = 9*10^9 N*m^2/C^2


other stuff for later
- Springs
- elastic stuff like ropes
