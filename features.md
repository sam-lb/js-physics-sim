- Springs

List of features to be added to the simulator
- ElectROstATic fORce (collisions of all kinds)
- Friction
- Drag
- rotation
- elastic stuff like ropes
- charges

Qualities of objects
- Mass, density, area, charge, color, moment of inertia, coefficients of friction (static and kinetic), drag coefficient, center of mass, 

Variables
- accleration, velocity, position, speed, translational kinetic energy, rotational kinetic energy, gravitational potential energy, elastic potential energy, angular velocity, angular acceleration, angle, momentum, angular momentum

global constants
- G = 6.67\*10^-11 m^3/(kg\*s^2): Gravitational Constant
- g = 9.81 m/s^2:                 Acceleration due to gravity on Earth
- e = 1.60 \* 10^(-19) Coul:      Magnitude of electron charge
- k = 9 \* 10^9 N\*m^2/C^2:       Coulomb's law constant

Current Task: Rectangle Collisions.
- Must involve both linear and rotational collision responses
- Should work in states of consistent contact
